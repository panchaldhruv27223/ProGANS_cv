# 🖼️ Low-to-High Resolution Image Generation using ProGAN

This project demonstrates the use of **Progressive Growing of GANs (ProGAN)** to convert **low-resolution images** into **high-resolution images**.

ProGAN is a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that progressively grows both the generator and discriminator, allowing it to generate high-quality and stable high-resolution images.

## 🚀 Features

- Converts low-resolution images to high-resolution images.
- Uses **Progressive Growing of GANs** for stable training.
- Training with custom datasets or standard image datasets.
- Modular code for easy experimentation and extension.
